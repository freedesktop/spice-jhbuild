This is a jhbuild moduleset to build spice (and optionnally libvirt) with
smartcard support.
To use it, you first have to download and install jhbuild from
http://git.gnome.org/browse/jhbuild/
It should be a simple matter of:
git clone git://git.gnome.org/jhbuild
cd jhbuild
./autogen.sh --prefix=....
make install

Then you can clone this jhbuild moduleset into ~/spice:
mkdir -p ~/spice
git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/~teuf/spice-jhbuild ~/spice/spice-jhbuild
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc

and it will build qemu with spice support and smartcard support and
spice-gtk as the spice client.

The source are downloaded into ~/spice, and the binaries installed to
~/spice-run. If you want to tweak these paths, you can edit the
~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc file, it should be self-explanatory.

It can be run with something like:
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc run qemu-system-x86_64 -vga qxl -spice port=5924,disable-ticketing -enable-kvm
-m 512 -nographic -usbdevice tablet -cdrom ~/isos/livecd.iso
and
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc run spicy
(spice is running on localhost:5924 with the command line above)

If you run
jhbuild -f ~/spice/spice-jhbuild/jhbuildrc virt-manager
libvirt and virt-manager will be built instead.
